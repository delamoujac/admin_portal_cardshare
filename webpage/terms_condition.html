          <h3>4. Payment Terms</h3>
          <h4>4.1. General Payment Terms</h4>
<p><b>Platform</b>
You understand that the prices for product or menu items
displayed through the Platform may differ from the prices offered
or published by Merchants for the same product or menu items
and/or from prices available at other third-party websites/mobile
applications. Prices for product or menu items displayed through
the Platform may not be the lowest prices at which the product
or menu items are sold.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the Platform, Errands.pro does not
always know how much a Merchant will charge for a particular
product or menu item. Where your cart includes product or menu
items for which Errands.pro does not know the exact price to be
charged by the Merchant, Errands.pro may designate an
estimated subtotal for such product and menu items (the
“Estimated Subtotal”). Similarly, where Errands.pro does not
know the exact price of certain or all fees associated with the
order, including any applicable taxes and/or Errands.pro fees, we
may designate an estimate for such fees (the “Estimated Fees”).
If you have included product or menu items in your cart that are
subject to Estimated Subtotal and/or Estimated Fees, we will
provide you with an estimated total. Merchants may charge more
or less than the Estimated Subtotal for products or menu items
you order. Similarly, we may charge more or less than the
Estimated Fees based upon the final prevailing price of
Merchant’s goods. In some cases, we may not be able to provide
Estimated Subtotal or Estimated Fees, such as when the
merchandise cost is unknown or we are otherwise unable to
predict fees. Errands.pro reserves the right to determine final
prevailing pricing of all product or menu items ordered through
the Platform. In cases in which prevailing pricing is different than
the Estimated Subtotal and/or Estimated Fees, what you are
ultimately charged may be different than the estimated total. You
acknowledge and agree to pay the prevailing pricing and fees,
even if they differ from the Estimated Subtotal and/or Estimated
Fees. Please visit our Help Center to learn more about how
product or menu items are priced.</p>
<p>Certain features of the Platform, including placing orders, may
require you to pay fees to Errands.pro. Errands.pro may change,
or add, fees for use of our Platform at any time as we deem
necessary or appropriate for our business. You will have an
opportunity to review and accept an estimate of the fees that you
will be charged, as applicable. The final fees may differ from the
estimate. In all cases, you acknowledge and accept that a fee will
be charged and you agree to pay said fee. We encourage you to
check our Site or visit our Help Center periodically to learn more
about how we charge for the Platform.</p>
<p>Errands.pro has no obligation to itemize its costs, profits or
margins when publishing prices on the Platform and reserves the
right to change such prices at any time, at its discretion. You are
liable for all transaction taxes on the Platform provided under
these Terms (other than taxes based on Errands.pro’ income).</p>
<p>Errands.pro will charge the payment method you specify at the
time of purchase or as otherwise specified by you in your
account information. We may also place a pre-authorization hold
on your payment method, as described in Section 4.3.</p>
<p>Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, except as
expressly provided in Section 4.2, and will be quoted in the local
currency of the location where the order is being delivered or
picked up. Except as expressly provided in Section 4.2,
Errands.pro has no obligation to provide refunds or credits.
However, Errands.pro, in its sole discretion, may provide users
with refunds, courtesy delivery or product credits, or make
promotional offers with different features and different rates to
any consumers. These credits and offers may be used for future
transactions on the Platform. Such credits or offers are nontransferrable,
may not be resold, and are not redeemable for
cash or other consideration. Errands.pro reserves its right to
expire, limit, or modify any credits or promotion at any time. If
your account is cancelled for any or no reason, you may forfeit
any pending, current, or future credits or promotional offers and
any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your
account without prior notice to you.</p>
<p><b>Referral Program</b>
Errands.pro may offer a referral program (“Referral Program”),
allowing consumers to earn courtesy delivery or product credits,
or other promotional rewards (“Referral Program Rewards”) by
inviting their eligible friends to register as new Errands
consumers using a unique referral code (“Referral Program
Codes”). Referral Program Codes must be used for the intended
audience and purposes, and may not be sold or transferred in
any manner or made available to the general public (whether
posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly
permitted by Errands.pro. Referral Program Rewards are nontransferrable,
may not be resold, and are not redeemable for
cash or other consideration. You agree we may change the terms
and conditions of the Referral Program, terminate the Referral
Program, or expire, deduct, limit, or modify your Referral
Program Rewards at any time for any reason, including but not
limited to, the event that Errands.pro determines or believes that
your participation in the Referral Program or use or redemption of
Referral Program Codes was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or
otherwise in violation of these Terms. You can learn more about
Errands.pro’ Referral Program here.</p>
      
          <h4>4.2. Payment Authorization</h4>
        
          <p>You authorize Errands.pro to charge all sums for orders that you
make to the payment method designated in your account. When
you place an order order through Errands.pro, a temporary preauthorization
hold is placed on your designated payment method
to verify that the card is valid and has funds available for your
intended purchase. The amount of this pre-authorization hold
may be greater or less than the order total quoted at checkout.
However, your payment will be captured up to 24 hours after your
order is completed or cancelled. In the event that the preauthorization
is greater than the final amount, the difference will
be released after your order is completed or cancelled;
depending on your bank, it may take up to 5 business days to
receive access to these released funds.</p>
<p>Errands.pro also places an initial temporary pre-authorization
hold on each new payment method you add to your account.</p>
<p>Errands.pro reserves the right to request additional information
from you if we have reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that
a payment method may be fraudulent.</p>

<h4>4.3. Delinquent Accounts</h4>
          <p>If payment due on your account is delinquent, we reserve the
right to suspend or terminate your access to the Platform; your
account information may be sent to a collection agency/debt
collector and you may be subject to a collection action, and
payment of collection related fees and costs. If you have
questions regarding an outstanding balance on your account,
please contact us via our Help Center.</p>
<p>If your payment card expires or is replaced by your issuing bank,
the card network may provide us with updated card details
associated with the same account. We may use these new
details in order to help prevent any interruption to the Platform. If
you would like to use a different payment method or remove a
saved payment method from your account, please visit your
account settings to update your billing information.</p>
          <h4>4.4. Consumer Not Available</h4>
          <p>Errands.pro reserves the right to charge you the full order
amount, including any Errands.pro fees, if you are not at the
designated delivery location when the Courier arrives to
complete the delivery or if you fail to pick up an order from a
Merchant.</p>
<h4>4.5. Cancelled Orders</h4>
          <p>If you cancel your order, you may be charged depending on what
stage the order was in when you cancelled. You will be notified of
any applicable charges before you complete your cancellation.
You can learn more about order cancellations in our Help Center.</p>
<h4>4.6. Returned Items</h4>
          <p>If an item has to be returned for any reason, you may be subject
to a non-refundable $15 return/restocking fee. For alcohol items,
the Courier reserves the right, at his or her discretion, to refuse
delivery and return the item(s) if the name on your ID does not
match the name on your order, if you are not at least twenty-one
(21) years old ("Legal Age"), if you cannot provide a bona-fide
government-issued photo identification that shows you are of
Legal Age, or if you are visibly intoxicated.</p>

          <h3>5. Third-Party Interactions</h3>

<h3>14. Notice</h3>
<p>Errands.pro may give notice by any means of communication
reasonably anticipated to notify you of the information provided.
You agree that all notices, disclosures, and other
communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any
legal requirement that such communications be in writing or be
delivered in a particular manner. You agree that you have the
ability to store such electronic communications such that they
remain accessible to you in an unchanged form. By way of
example only, such communication may be a general notice on
the Platform or via email to the email address listed on your
Errands.pro account. It is your obligation to update your account
information so that we may contact you as may be necessary.
Such notice shall be deemed to have been given 48 hours after
dispatch. If physical notice (e.g., US Mail) is used, then such
notice shall be deemed to have been given 7 days after dispatch.</p>
<p>Except as explicitly described in the Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration section, you may give notice to Errands.pro (such
notice shall be deemed given when received by Errands.pro) at
any time by any of the following: letter delivered by nationally
recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage
prepaid mail to Errands.pro at the following address:</p>
<h3>15. Assignment </h3>
<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under
these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms in
whole or in part at any time to any entity without your notice or
consent. Any purported assignment by you in violation of this
section shall be void.</p>
<h3>16. Term and Termination of Agreement</h3>
<p>These Terms are effective until terminated by you or Errands.pro
as described below. Your rights under these Terms will terminate
automatically without notice from Errands.pro if you fail to
comply with any of these Terms (including by violating any
license restriction contained in these Terms). In addition,
Errands.pro may in its sole discretion terminate your user
account on the Platform or suspend or terminate your access to
the Platform at any time without notice. We also reserve the right
to modify or discontinue the Platform at any time (including by
limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Platform) without
notice to you. We will have no liability whatsoever on account of

your access to or use of the Platform. You may terminate these
Terms at any time by closing your account, uninstalling the App,
and ceasing use of the Platform. Sections 4.4, 5, 7-17, and 19-21

<h3>17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h3>
<h4>17.1. Disputes</h4>
<p>Errands.pro is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in,
makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no
responsibility or liability with respect to any communications,
transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever
between you and any other user, any Courier, or Merchant, or
other third party. Disputes between you and Errands.pro are
subject to this Section 17. You and Errands.pro agree that these
Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration
Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration
provisions in these Terms.</p>
<h4>17.2. Generally</h4>
<p>In the interest of resolving Disputes between you and Errands.pro
in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and
Errands.pro agree that every Dispute arising in connection with
these Terms will be resolved by binding individual arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration
uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and can be
subject to very limited review by courts. While the parties will be
permitted to engage in discovery or exchange of non-privileged
information relevant to the dispute, arbitration may allow for more
limited discovery allowed for in court. Arbitrators can award the
same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement
to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating
to any aspect of these Terms, the Platform, or your relationship
with us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of
whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these
Terms.</p>
<h3>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO
THESE TERMS, YOU AND ERRANDS.PRO ARE EACH
WAIVING THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT OR TO PARTICIPATE
IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</h3>
<h4>17.3. Exceptions</h4>
<p>Despite the provisions of the paragraph directly above, we both
agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive,
preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (1) Bring
an individual action in small claims court; (2) Pursue an
enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local
agency if that action is available; or (3) File suit in a court of law
to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
<h4>17.4. Arbitrator</h4>
<p>Any arbitration between you and Errands.pro shall be conducted
by a single arbitrator, governed by JAMS pursuant to its
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (collectively,
“JAMS Rules”), as modified by these Terms, and administered by
JAMS. The JAMS Rules and fee information are available at
www.jamsadr.org or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. The
arbitrator is bound by these arbitration terms. All issues are for
the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues
relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrabilty of this
Section 17.</p>
<h4>17.5. Notice Process</h4>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
notice of the Dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal
Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical
address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").</p>
<p>Errands.pro’ address for Notice is:</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made
by you or Errands.pro must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.</p>
<h4>17.6. Fees</h4>
<p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, you
will be required to pay $250 to initiate the arbitration. If the
arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Errands.por will
pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and
arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your
own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable
law provide otherwise.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take
place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For
individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be
initiated in the State of California, United States of America. You
and Errands.pro further agree to submit to the personal
jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Suffolk County,
Massachusetts in order to compel arbitration, to stay
proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. If a claim
is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration
will be conducted: (1) Solely on the basis of documents
submitted to the arbitrator; or (2) Through a non-appearance
based telephone hearing.</p>
<p>If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or
the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an
improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all
fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. In that case, you agree
to reimburse Errands.pro for all monies previously disbursed by it
that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to
explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the
decision and award, if any, are based.</p>
<p>The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time
during the proceeding and upon request from either party made
within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
<h4>17.7. No Class or Representative Actions</h4>
<h3>YOU AND ERRANDS.PRO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING.</h3>
<p>Further, unless both you and Errands.pro agree otherwise, the
arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims,
and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative
or class proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that this
“No Class or Representative Actions” section is void or
unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed
on a class or representative basis, then the arbitration provisions
set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and
the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate
disputes.</p>
<h4>17.8. 30-Day Right to Opt Out</h4>
<p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration
and class action waiver provisions set forth above by submitting
a request here. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of
your creating an account with Errands.pro or the effective date of
the first set of Terms containing a Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration section, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be
bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these
paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions,
Errands.pro also will not be bound by them.</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN,
NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SUPERSEDE, AMEND,
OR MODIFY THE TERMS OF ANY SEPARATE AGREEMENT(S)
BETWEEN YOU AND ERRANDS.PRO RELATING TO YOUR
WORK AS AN EMPLOYEE OR USE OF THE PLATFORM AS AN
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FLEET AGREEMENT)
GOVERNING YOUR SERVICES AS A CONTRACTOR. FOR THE
AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IF YOU ARE AN INDEPENDENT
CONTRACTOR, OPTING OUT OF THE ARBITRATION
AGREEMENT SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 17 WILL NOT
AFFECT ANY AGREEMENT BY YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES
COVERED BY YOUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FLEET
AGREEMENT) WITH ERRANDS.PRO.</p>
<h4>17.9. Modifications</h4>
<p>Except for inconsequential changes that do not affect any rights
or obligations herein, Errands.pro will provide thirty (30) days'
notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Platform,
sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are
logged into your account. Amendments will become effective
thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Platform or sent to
you, or otherwise notified when you are logged into your
account. Changes to this section will otherwise apply
prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If
a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on
"Modifications" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection
shall be severed from the section entitled “Dispute Resolution
and Arbitration,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section in existence after you
began using the Platform. You may otherwise reject the change
by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change
to Errands.pro’ address for Notice, in which case your account
with Errands.pro will be immediately terminated and this
arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the
amendments you reject, will survive.</p>
<h3>18. Modification of these Terms</h3>
<p>Except as explicitly described in the Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration section, we reserve the right to update or modify the
Terms at any time without prior notice, and such changes will be
effective immediately upon being posted through the Platform,
except as set forth below. These Terms identify the date of last
update. Except as explicitly described in the Dispute Resolution
and Arbitration section, your use of the Platform following any
such change constitutes your agreement to be bound by the
modified Terms. In the case of material changes to these Terms,
we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change, such
as through sending an email to the address you may have used
to register for an account, through a pop-up window on the
Platform, or other similar mechanism.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that if Errands.pro modifies any
provision of these Terms (including any information referenced at
hyperlinks), other than the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
section herein, you will not have a renewed opportunity to opt out
of arbitration. You further acknowledge and agrees that unless
the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section herein is materially
different from any prior arbitration provision with Errands.pro to
which you may be bound, your acceptance of these Terms does
not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if
applicable).</p>
<p>Except as explicitly described in the Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration section, material changes to these Terms will be
effective upon the earlier of: (1) Your first use of the Platform with
actual notice of such change, or (2) thirty (30) days from posting
of such change.</p>
<p>Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in
accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the
dispute arose. We encourage you to review these Terms
frequently to stay informed of the latest modifications.</p>
<h3>19. Confidentiality</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that when using the Platform, you
may have direct or indirect access or exposure to Errands.pro’
confidential information ("Confidential Information"). Confidential

information, package information, and the transaction volume,
marketing and business plans, business, financial, technical,
operational and such other nonpublic information (whether
disclosed in writing or verbally) that Errands.pro designates as
being proprietary or confidential or that you should reasonably
know to treat as confidential.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that: (1) all Confidential Information
shall remain the exclusive property of the Errands.pro; (2) you
shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose except in
furtherance of your use of the Platform; (3) you shall not disclose

store or keep Confidential Information and shall return or destroy
(with confirmation of destruction) all Confidential Information
upon the termination of your use of the Platform or at the request
of Errands.pro.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not
include any information to the extent it: (1) is or becomes part of
the public domain through no action or omission by you; (2) was
possessed by you prior to your use of the Platform without an
obligation of confidentiality; or (3) is disclosed to you by a third
party having no obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto.</p>
<h3>20. General</h3>
<p>Governing Law. These Terms are If a lawsuit or court proceeding
is permitted under these Terms, you and Errands.pro agree to
submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County,
California for the purpose of litigating any Dispute. We operate
the Platform from our offices in California, and we make no
representation that materials included in the Platform are
appropriate or available for use in other locations. No joint
venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists
between you, Errands.pro or any third-party provider as a result
of the Terms or use of the Platform.</p>
<p>Waiver and Severability. Except as explicitly described in the
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section, if any provision of
these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision
shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to
the fullest extent under law. The failure of Errands.pro to enforce
any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver
of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by
Errands.pro in writing.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement. These Terms comprise the entire agreement
between you and a Errands.pro and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements,
whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the subject
matter contained in these Terms.</p>
